Uber has a long-standing policy that we do not sell your data--we are not data brokers, and we don’t put your data on the open market. However, under the CCPA, some sharing of personal information necessary to provide you with personalized ads may be considered a “sale,” even if no money is exchanged. We aren’t changing how we share your data, but we want to make sure you have choices under the new definition of “sale.”

In the past 12 months, Uber has sold your personal data to the following categories of third parties:
-Advertising network providers
